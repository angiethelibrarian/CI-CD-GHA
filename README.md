## Description

This application uses GitHub Actions to set up a simple CI/CD pipeline for managing code quality and deployment.

## Installation

- Download the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project folder.
- Install the necessary project dependencies using your package manager (e.g., npm or yarn).
- Go to your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions, and add any required secrets, such as API keys or deployment credentials.
- Create a .github/workflows folder in your project and add the workflow YAML files for running tests and deploying the application.
- Open a Pull Request to the develop branch to verify that tests run automatically, and merge changes to the main branch to ensure the deployment workflow works.

## Usage
 
When a Pull Request is opened for the develop branch, it automatically runs Cypress tests to check the code. 
After the code is merged into the main branch, the application is deployed. This setup makes it easy to test and deploy code automatically.
